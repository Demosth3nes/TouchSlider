TouchSlider
===========

This is a modified version of the slider found in 'JavaScript and jQuery' by Jon Duckett.

I have changed the way it works by instead of having the slides layered on top of each other, a container holds all the slides in row. As the slider changes the group is translated showing a new slide. I have also incorporated a touch function by using hammer.js.
